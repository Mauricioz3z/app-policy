    <p>
      Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the <strong>Color Circuit</strong>
      mobile application (the "App") operated by us ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing,
      or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. License to Use</h2>
    <p>
      We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use
      the App for your personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes on a device you own or control,
      subject to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, distribute, sell, or sublicense any part of the App;</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to extract the source code of the App;</li>
      <li>Use the App for any commercial purpose or for any public display without our prior written consent;</li>
      <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the App;</li>
      <li>Use cheats, exploits, automation software, bots, or any unauthorized third-party software
          that interacts with the App;</li>
      <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content in the App — including but not limited to graphics, artwork, animations, music,
      sound effects, gameplay mechanics, and code — is the exclusive property of the App's developer
      and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. Nothing in these Terms transfers
      any intellectual property rights to you.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The App is free to play and is supported by advertising, including banner ads, interstitial ads,
      and optional rewarded ads provided by Google AdMob and other advertising networks. By using the
      App, you consent to the display of these advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rewarded ads (for features such as undoing a move, adding a capsule, or skipping a level) are
      entirely optional. Choosing not to watch a rewarded ad will not prevent you from playing the game,
      though certain in-game benefits will only be available upon ad completion.
    </p>

    <h2>5. In-App Features and Virtual Items</h2>
    <p>
      Any in-game benefits obtained through rewarded ads (such as extra moves or level skips) are
      virtual items with no real-world monetary value. They are licensed to you, not sold, and may be
      modified, removed, or disabled by us at any time without notice or compensation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the App is also governed by our
      <a href="policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
      Please review the Privacy Policy to understand our practices regarding data collection and use.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE,
        OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE
        OF THE APP, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL
        LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE APP SHALL NOT
        EXCEED ONE U.S. DOLLAR (USD $1.00).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, agents, and
      employees from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including
      reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use
      of the App or your violation of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App integrates third-party services (such as Google AdMob) that are subject to their own
      terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content, practices, or terms of
      those third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice,
      for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties,
      or for any other reason at our sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with
      an updated effective date. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your
      acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the App.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard
      to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the
      competent courts of the jurisdiction in which we operate.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be
      limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining Terms remain in full
      force and effect.
    </p>
