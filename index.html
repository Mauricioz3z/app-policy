    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Color Circuit</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") handles
      information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your
      privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App itself does <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)
      such as your name, email address, or location. The only data stored by the App is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Game progress</strong> — your highest unlocked level is saved locally on your device
          using the device's own storage (shared preferences). This data never leaves your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Advertising — Google AdMob</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, a third-party advertising service provided by Google LLC,
      to display advertisements including banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      AdMob may collect and use the following information automatically to serve relevant ads:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID / IDFA)</li>
      <li>IP address and approximate location (country/region level)</li>
      <li>Device type, operating system version, and language</li>
      <li>App usage and interaction data (ad impressions, clicks)</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Google AdMob's data collection and use are governed by Google's own Privacy Policy, available at:<br/>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising → Personalized Ads (off)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Rewarded Ads</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers optional rewarded ads that grant in-game benefits (such as undoing a move, adding
      a capsule, or skipping a level). Watching these ads is entirely voluntary. No additional personal
      data is collected beyond what AdMob already processes as described in Section 2.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information,
      please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Game progress data is stored entirely on your local device and is not transmitted to our servers.
      We rely on Google AdMob's security infrastructure for ad-related data, which employs
      industry-standard security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>
      Ads displayed in the App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not
      responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their
      privacy policies before providing any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
      with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes
      your acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding personal data processed by our
      advertising partners (such as the right to access, correct, or delete data). To exercise these
      rights with respect to advertising data, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy and tools at
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
